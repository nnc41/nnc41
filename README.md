## 🧩 Project Highlight – OwlHack SEPTA App

At **OwlHack 2025**, I joined a team to design a prototype app focused on **SEPTA public transit**.

**Goal**

Give riders clearer information about **accessibility and safety** around train stations and stops.

**What we built**

- A front-end app to browse stations and nearby locations  
- Simple visuals to show things like accessibility and walkability  
- Clean, straightforward interface built during the hackathon weekend
